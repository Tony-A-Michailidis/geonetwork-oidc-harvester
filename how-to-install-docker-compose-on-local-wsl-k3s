To install Docker Compose on Debian 12 (Bookworm) x86_64, you'll need to first ensure you have Docker Engine installed. Then, you can install the Docker Compose plugin, verify the installation, and you're ready to use it.

Prerequisites:

Docker Engine: Docker Compose requires Docker Engine to be installed. If you don't have it already, you can install it using the following steps:
Update the package index: 
    sudo apt update
Install necessary packages: 
    sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
Add Docker's official GPG key: 
    sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-official-archive-key.ring
Add the Docker repository: 
    echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf,i386] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
Update the package index again: 
    sudo apt update
Install Docker Engine: 
    sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
Start the Docker service: 
    sudo systemctl start docker

Docker Compose Plugin: Once Docker Engine is installed, you can install the Docker Compose plugin.

Installation 
Steps:

Update the package index: 
    sudo apt update
Install the Docker Compose plugin: 
    sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin
Verify the installation: 
    docker compose version

This will install Docker Compose as a plugin for Docker CLI, allowing you to use docker compose commands.
